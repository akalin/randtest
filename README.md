Run by doing:

```
go build .
```
in this directory, and then
```
./randtest
```

It should print out something like:

```
Outlook not so good
deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef
```

although from reading `main.go` you'd expect it to print something more like:

```
Signs point to yes
